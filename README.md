# Covid19_Testing_Data
This repository intends to host a python pipeline for the analysis of testing data of Covid-19 in humans, comparing countries using a variety of variables. For this work, machine learning approaches will be applied. The data for this work is retrieved from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing.

The goals in this work are: 

  - pre-process the data and solve any issues with it;
  - produce a statiscal analysis of the resulting data;
  - construct machine learning models and apply them on the testing data;
  - apply deep learning techniques to the data and compare with the machine learning models.

Note: The use of an updated version of the dataset can produce some issues with this pipeline, since it might occur an introduction of new variables like vaccination and so forth.
